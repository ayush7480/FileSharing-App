How do you plan on deploying this to the production environment?



Choose a Hosting Platform:
Common choices include cloud providers like AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, or Heroku.
Select a platform based on your budget, requirements, and familiarity.

Prepare the Production Environment:
Set up a production-ready web server, such as Nginx or Apache, to serve as a reverse proxy for your Flask application.
Configure the web server to handle HTTPS using an SSL certificate (you can use Let's Encrypt for a free SSL certificate).
